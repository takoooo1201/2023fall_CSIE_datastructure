Given a binary tree represented as a list of integers (where -1 indicates a null child), write a program to:

Build the binary tree using the given list.
Implement and print the preorder traversal of the tree.
Implement and print the inorder traversal of the tree.
Implement and print the postorder traversal of the tree.

Example Input
11
8 2 3 1 9 6 -1 -1 7 -1 5
Example Output
8 2 1 9 7 3 6 5
1 2 7 9 8 6 5 3
1 7 9 2 5 6 3 8

P.S.
1.The list is a level-order sequence(typically used for serialization and deserialization of binary trees because it allows the structure of the tree to be efficiently reconstructed without ambiguity)
2.Values needed to be printed on a single line, separated by spaces, without leading or trailing spaces.
